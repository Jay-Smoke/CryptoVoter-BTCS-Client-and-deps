CONSENT
By installing, using or continuing to use this software you are consenting to CryptoVoter's End User License Agreement (EULA) and you agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. 

LICENSE - OPEN SOURCE (AGPL) AND COMMERICAL
The CryptoVoter voting software is developed by Blockchain Innovation Labs, Inc., ("BCILabs") and is dual licensed under open-source and commercial product licenses.   
By offering different licensing options, BCILabs supports giving options to open-source communities and companies to pursue different product strategies.  Accordingly, BCI Labs offers CryptoVoter both under a commercial license for proprietary uses and is offered open-source under the GNU Affero General Public License, either version 3 of the License (AGPLv3) or (at your option) any later version, which requires any software derived from or using CryptoVoter to also be released open source under the same AGPLv3.  
Therefore, in order to develop and use CryptoVoter, you must adhere to the obligations and definitions required by the AGPLv3. If you cannot adhere to the rules of the open-source license, a commercial license is required to use the product.
A copy of the AGPLv3 is included with this software and can also be found online:  http://www.gnu.org/licenses.
