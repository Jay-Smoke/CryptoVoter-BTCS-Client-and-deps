ABOUT 

Welcome to the CryptoVoter Voting Client â€“ BTCS Voter Edition [beta].

We are cryptographic currency developers looking to decentralize cryptocoin development through blockchain-based voting that allows for decentralized objective consensus on development related issues and more.

It works by creating special vanity Bitcoin addresses corresponding with published question-answer pairs.  This newly created special vanity Bitcoin address ("vanity voting address") is imported into the user's wallet allowing them to send coins to themselves to publicly register votes.

CryptoVoter is wholly-owned and operated by Blockchain Innovation Labs, Inc.
